2016-08-22 00:29 No cad software to use.
I have no software to model schematic which used a neon bulb. I've just purchased some of them and 2 battery testers from which I will get appropriate ampere meters from Aliexpress. Hope them will help :D

2016-08-22 14:40 Found library for neon bulb.
Finally I found library for neon bulb so that I could create schematic in Kicad. This library was folked from another github repository. My bad, I forgot his/her name. Will mentioned in README later.

2016-08-22 21:30 Suspend to wait for ordered components.
It may takes couple of weeks to get my ordered neon bulb and needles, so it should be suspended here till that time. I will focus on oximeter while waiting for them.
